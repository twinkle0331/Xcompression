OakleyMost people have heard the phrase 'Silence is golden' and many would agree with it.
People with screaming children running wild around the house or working in a noisy office.
For me, however, it meant something entirely different.
Silence consumed my whole life.
It suppressed things I could never express.
My silence was responsible for my family's happiness.

Silence was my prison.
"Are you ready to leave, Oakley?
Cole's waiting outside," Mum said in the soft tone she used for me.
She leant against my doorframe and smiled.
